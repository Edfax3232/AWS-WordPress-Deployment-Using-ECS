# AWS-WordPress-Deployment-Using-ECS
This architecture represents a WordPress web application deployed on Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) with load balancing, routing, monitoring, and CDN support.
🧱 Architecture Components & Flow
# 1. Client Access Flow
Users access the application via Route 53 (DNS).

Route 53 routes requests to Amazon CloudFront (CDN) which caches and delivers content closer to the user.

CloudFront sends requests to the Internet Gateway of the VPC.

# 2. Load Balancing Layer
The Application Load Balancer (ALB) receives the request from CloudFront.

The ALB distributes traffic across ECS services running in two public subnets in:

Availability Zone 1a

Availability Zone 1b

# 3. Application Layer
Amazon ECS is used to host the WordPress containerized application.

ECS is deployed across both AZs for high availability and fault tolerance.

# 4. Developer Interaction
Developers push WordPress code or container images into ECS clusters.

Code updates may come from CI/CD tools or a code repo.

# 5. Monitoring & Security
IAM Roles grant ECS tasks the permissions needed to pull images, write to logs, etc.

CloudWatch monitors metrics (CPU, memory, errors, etc.) and sets alarms.

# 🔄 Network & Subnetting
The VPC is divided into subnets:

Public Subnets: ECS tasks are deployed here and can access the internet.

Private Subnet (not detailed, but visible on the right): May be used for backend services or database.

# 🚧 Common Deployment Challenges & Solutions
Challenge	Description	Solution
🔐 IAM Role Misconfiguration	ECS tasks can't access services (e.g., CloudWatch, S3)	Use correct task execution roles with least privilege
📦 ECS Task Definition Issues	Incorrect image URLs or resource limits cause failed deployments	Validate task definitions; test locally and use ECS Fargate if managing EC2 is complex
⚖️ ALB Health Check Failures	Tasks fail health checks and get deregistered	Ensure containers expose correct ports and paths, and health checks match
🌐 Network Misconfiguration	Incorrect subnet or security group blocks access	Ensure ECS tasks are in public subnets with internet access and open HTTP/HTTPS ports
📉 Auto Scaling Problems	ECS doesn’t scale up or down as expected	Set CloudWatch alarms and configure ECS service auto scaling policies properly
🐢 Slow App Performance	Lack of caching and distance to clients increases latency	Use CloudFront with caching policies to reduce load time
🛠️ WordPress Persistence	WordPress requires persistent storage (e.g., media uploads)	Use EFS (Elastic File System) for shared volume between tasks or S3 for media
💸 Cost Optimization	Over-provisioned resources lead to higher costs	Right-size ECS services, use Spot Instances, and enable Auto Scaling

# ✅ Best Practices
Use ECS Fargate for simplified container management (no EC2).

Attach EFS volumes to ECS for WordPress wp-content persistence.

Set up CloudWatch Logs for container output and errors.

Secure the app with HTTPS using an ACM certificate with ALB.

Deploy your RDS database (not shown) in a private subnet.
